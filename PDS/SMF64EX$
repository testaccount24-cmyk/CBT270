           FUNCTION:     Extract SMF TYPE64 (VSAM activity) records from
                         daily SMF.  Reformat the records and translate
                         binary time fields so that high level languages
                         can easily work with the output file.

           PURPOSE:      SMF Type 64 records give a picture of global
                         VSAM activity for the time period that the SMF
                         records were collected.  This data can be sorted
                         and selected for a variety of useful purposes.

                         1) It can show all VSAM activity by volume.  This
                            can aid in balancing the work load and selecting
                            CACHE candidate VSAM at the dataset level.

                         2) VSAM can be sorted by CICS region to see where
                            the active online VSAM is located.  Contending
                            datasets can then be seperated - the read only
                            datasets going to CACHE volumes.

                         3) Fragmented active VSAM can be globally viewed.

                         4) Unusually high VSAM EXCP counts with apparent
                            low accomplishments (ie the BUFSP is too small)
                            jump out of the woodwork.

           ADVANTAGE:    The unmanageable process of trying to keep the
                         VSAM data running efficiently now moves up to
                         the piont that it's only unwieldly.  Actually
                         this process can be put into the customers hands
                         and they can easily monitor their own data.

                         A paper that describes how this process can be used
                         to build and maintain VSAM volumes that benefit
                         from CACHE controllers is coming out in the Fall
                         1986 issue of CMG Transactions.

           NOTE:         A VSAM close of a dataset with an AUX INDEX will
                         generate duplicate TYPE 64 records for all of the
                         datasets componants.  Also, when the last job of
                         the day completes and the VSAM Catalog is closed,
                         the catalog activity (TYPE 64) record is apparently
                         posted to that last job.  So, don't spend time
                         trying to find out why that tiny CICS region is
                         doing so much activity to the VSAM catalog(s).
